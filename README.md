# MyToken Solidity Smart Contract
## Overview
This project implements a basic Solidity smart contract named `MyToken` that serves as a template for creating ERC20-like tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The contract includes functionalities for minting new tokens and burning existing tokens.

## Getting Started
### Execution

To deploy and interact with the `MyToken` contract:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have a Solidity development environment set up with a compatible compiler (version 0.8.0 or higher).
   - Optionally, install tools like Truffle or Hardhat for development and deployment automation.

2. **Deployment**:
   - Compile the `MyToken.sol` contract using a Solidity compiler (`solc`).
   - Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum network (mainnet, testnet) using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

3. **Interaction**:
   - Once deployed, interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets (such as MetaMask) or through custom applications using Web3.js.
